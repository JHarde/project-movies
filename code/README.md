# Technigo React Starter App

This is an app in which you can browse 20 popular movies on a list. You can see some details on the movies by clicking them. I wanted to show upcoming movies and movies with the best rating as well so I took some inspiration from Materials UI and implemented a dropdown menu so you can filter on these preferences. I also wanted to add additional information on the page with the movie details. I decided to list the production companies so the user can filter on other movies from the company. This proved to be the hardest task in this project. I am able to show these details but only by manipulating the id of a company in the browser. I am going to fix this so the user will be able to see this page through the provided link.
