# Project Movies

In this app the user can filter through three different views that all display movies. When clicking a movie, details about the movie will be shown. From there the user can see an overview, rating and the production companies. When clicking on the production company, the user can see additional movies from that company.

## The problem

The biggest problem was getting the link to the movie company to work, that took me a lot of time. After inspecting the code for quite a while I realised that it was a simple typeerror and was able to solve it!
